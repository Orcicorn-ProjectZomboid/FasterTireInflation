title=Faster Tire Inflation
description=Sick and tired of how insanely long it takes to inflate and deflate vehicle tires? [b]Me Too![/b]
description=
description=Faster Tire Inflation resolves this issue by cutting the overall inflation/deflation time in half.  What used to take over a minute now takes just slightly more than 30 seconds.

description=Is that still not fast enough for you?  Ya me either.  Use the included 10x variation of the mod to cut the animation time down even further to 1/10th the default values. Now you can inflate a tire in under 10 seconds!
